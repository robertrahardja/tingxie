‚è∫ "I have a Chinese vocabulary PDF file. Please do the following automatically: 1) Read and extract all Chinese words from the PDF, 2) Create
both simplified and traditional Chinese versions for each word, 3) Add Hanyu pinyin pronunciation, 4) Identify which words are
highlighted/darkened and mark them as important, 5) Download audio pronunciation files from the internet for each word and save them in an
'audio' folder, 6) Create a complete JSON file that links everything together with the structure: simplified, traditional, pinyin, audio
file path, and importance flag. Do this entire process automatically from start to finish."
